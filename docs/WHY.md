# Why This Exists

This project turns Gyazo into a universal capture inbox, not just a screenshot uploader.

## The core idea

- Capture first, organize later.
- Use one fast flow for screenshots and text snippets.
- Keep context (app, title, URL, timestamp) without extra typing.
- Make sharing and recall equally easy.

## Why not only the official Gyazo app

- Many people already use another capture tool (Shottr, CleanShot X, macOS Screenshot, custom scripts).
- Switching tools breaks muscle memory.
- This bridge lets any file-based workflow upload into Gyazo automatically.

## Why text as images

- Gyazo is optimized for visual browsing and quick sharing.
- OCR still gives searchability.
- Cards are easier to skim in a visual timeline than plain text blobs.

## Philosophy

- Small scripts over heavy apps.
- Local-first configuration, simple files, no lock-in.
- One practical pipeline for personal knowledge capture.
